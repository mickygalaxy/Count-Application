# React and Component Structure
Functional Components: I learned how to create functional components in React using JavaScript functions.
JSX: I used JSX to define the UI elements within the components. JSX allows me to write HTML-like syntax within my JavaScript code, making it easier to create React components.

# State Management
useState Hook: I used the useState hook to create a state variable (count) and a function to update it (setCount). This hook is essential for managing state in functional components.

# Event Handling
Event Handlers: I implemented event handlers (incrementHandler, decrementHandler, resetHandler) to handle button clicks. These handlers update the state based on user interactions.

# CSS Styling
Styling with CSS: I applied styles to my React components using an external CSS file (App.css). This helped me understand how to style React components to make my app visually appealing.

# Component Composition
Component Hierarchy: I created a parent div container that holds child elements, demonstrating how to compose components hierarchically in React.
